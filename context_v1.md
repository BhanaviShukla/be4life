## Summary

The be4life wedding website is an ambitious project that balances aesthetic elegance with functional utility. Currently at 30% completion, it has successfully established the visual foundation and core RSVP functionality. The dual-theme system is a unique differentiator that personalizes the experience for both partners.

The immediate focus should be on backend integration to capture RSVP data and building out the travel section to assist guests with logistics. With 11 months until the wedding, there's adequate time to implement the planned features while maintaining quality.

The project demonstrates strong technical foundations with modern tooling and thoughtful architecture. The biggest opportunity lies in transforming it from a beautiful static site into a dynamic, personalized guest experience platform that truly streamlines the wedding planning and attendance process.
